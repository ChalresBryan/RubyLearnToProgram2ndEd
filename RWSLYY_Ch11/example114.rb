Safer picture downloading. Adapt the picture-downloading/filerenaming program to your computer by adding some safety features to make sure you never overwrite a file. A few methods you
might find useful are File.exist? (pass it a filename, and it will return
true or false) and exit (like if return and Napoleon had a babyâ€”it kills
your program right where it stands; this is good for spitting out
an error message and then quitting).
